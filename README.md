The first [dev plan][original] was generated from this prompt: 
>Ok, that worked perfectly, but now that I think about it, I would like the user to have the ability to set how many items they want per page and for it to automatically resize the items and styles and whatnot, as well as put each page on its own shadowed card container to make it all look more clean. Does that make sense? Please consider everything closely and then write a dynamic-user-pdf-layout-adjustment-dev-plan.md with a step by step plan for implementing this without breaking any of the current function or styling

And the [completed dev plan][completed] is the same file after starting a new chat with the prequisite files along with the plan added into the context and prompted thusly:
>Please proceed with following @dynamic-user-pdf-layout-adjustment-dev-plan.md step by step beginning at step 1, making sure to update/summarize the plan with your progress as you go along @route.ts @page.tsx@page.tsx @RequisitionForm.tsx

And then the summary.md

[original]: ./dynamic-user-pdf-layout-adjustment-dev-plan.md
[completed]: ./dynamic-user-pdf-layout-adjustment-dev-plan-FINAL.md
